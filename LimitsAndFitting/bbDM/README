Step1: Convert the rootfiles into workspace. 

This can be done using AddRooDataHistFast.C. This macro need the required rootfiles in the data directory. 

root -l -b -q AddRooDataHistFast.C

For each file it will create a new rootfile with postfix ws and will be saved in the same directory. 

This has now workspace with all the histograms converted into RooDataHist. The shapes are now ready to be used for limits. 

Step2: Create datacards for each mass point. 

I have created one template datacard combining all the datacards and adding rate parameters for major background (rate param still need work). This is done to construct a model which will be used for the fit and extracting the limits. 

The template combined datacards "comb_tmpl.txt" can be changed and a new datacard can created for each mass point using the script: RunLimitOnAll.py

Create the datacards using: 

python RunLimitOnAll.py create

Run the datacards using: 

python RunLimitOnAll.py run

It will print the limit values for each mass point on your screen. These values can be used to draw the limit plot or just a table. 

Step3: Plotting. 

For plotting you can use following macros, 

First create 1d TGraph for each quantile and then in the second step plot them on same canvas with required cosmetics.
